// The babysitter
// - starts no earlier than 5:00PM
// - leaves no later than 4:00AM
// - gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
// - gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
// - gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
// - gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)
//
// Feature:
// As a babysitter
// In order to get paid for 1 night of work
// I want to calculate my nightly charge
