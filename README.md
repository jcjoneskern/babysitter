#Babysitter Kata

Kata from here: https://gist.github.com/jameskbride/5482722

Ways to view the tests:
* Can be seen using Jasmine's HTML spec runner here: https://jcjoneskern.github.io/babysitter/
* Can also be seen by cloning the repository, then within the cloned directory:
  1. In the command line, run `npm install`.
  2. Tests can then be run by typing `gulp` in the command line. Green dots indicate the test has passed.
